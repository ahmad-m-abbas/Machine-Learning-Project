# Fashion-MNIST Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the code and report for our project on classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using machine learning algorithms. The project was completed as part of the ENCS5341 - Machine Learning and Data Science course at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

## Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with 10 classes in total.

## Algorithms
We implemented three machine learning algorithms for image classification: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The technical details of each algorithm are explained in the report.

## Results
Our findings demonstrate impressive accuracy ratings for the SVM, KNN, and RF methods, with SVM achieving the highest overall accuracy. The report includes detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations of the results.

## Code
The code for this project is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The code is organized into separate files for each algorithm, as well as a main file for running the experiments and generating the results. 

To run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.7
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Report
The report for this project is included in the repository as a PDF file. It includes a detailed explanation of the algorithms, evaluation metrics, and visualizations of the results.

## Authors
This project was completed by Ahmad Abbas and Loor Sawalhi, under the supervision of Yazan Abu Farha.
